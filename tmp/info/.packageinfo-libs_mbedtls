Config:
config LIBMBEDTLS_DEBUG_C
	depends on PACKAGE_libmbedtls
	bool "Enable debug functions"
	default n
	help
	 This option enables mbedtls library's debug functions.

	 It increases the uncompressed libmbedtls binary size
	 by around 60 KiB (for an ARMv5 platform).

	 Usually, you don't need this, so don't select this if you're unsure.

config LIBMBEDTLS_HAVE_ARMV8CE_AES
	depends on PACKAGE_libmbedtls
	bool
	default y
	prompt "Enable use of the ARMv8 Crypto Extensions"
	depends on aarch64 && !TARGET_bcm27xx && !TARGET_bcm4908
	help
	 Use of the ARMv8 Crypto Extensions greatly increase performance
	 (up to 4x faster on AES-GCM while 10x faster on raw AES).

	 Related instructions should be included in all modern Aarch64
	 devices, except some wastes like Broadcom.
	 If you don't sure, say Y here.

config LIBMBEDTLS_HAVE_SSE2
	depends on PACKAGE_libmbedtls
	bool
	default y if !TARGET_x86_legacy && !TARGET_x86_geode
	prompt "Enable use of x86 SSE2 instructions"
	depends on x86_64 || i386
	help
	 Use of SSE2 instructions greatly increase performance (up to
	 3x faster) with a minimum (~0.2%, or 23KB) increase in package
	 size, but it will bring no benefit if your hardware does not
	 support them, such as Geode GX and LX.  In this case you may
	 save 23KB by saying yes here.  AMD Geode NX, and Intel
	 Pentium 4 and above support SSE2.

config LIBMBEDTLS_HKDF_C
	depends on PACKAGE_libmbedtls
	bool "Enable the HKDF algorithm (RFC 5869)"
	default n
	help
	 This option adds support for the Hashed Message Authentication Code
	 (HMAC)-based key derivation function (HKDF).
