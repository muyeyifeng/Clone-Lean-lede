Subject: [PATCH 23/50] arm64: dts: rockchip: enable sdr-104 for sdmmc on
 Quartz A

Now that we have working io-domain support, we can enable higher date
rates on the sdmmc card.

Before:
Timing buffered disk reads:  68 MB in  3.08 seconds =  22.07 MB/sec

After:
Timing buffered disk reads: 188 MB in  3.02 seconds =  62.29 MB/sec
